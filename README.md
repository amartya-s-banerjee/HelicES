HelicES (Helical Electronic Structure) is a MATLAB package for electronic structure calculations of nanomaterials with helical and cyclic symmetries. 
In essence, it implements a spectral method for solving the Schrödinger equation, as it applies to quasi-one-dimensional materials and structures.
The package can be used to compute the electronic states of important technological materials such as nanotubes (of arbitrary chirality), nanowires, 
nanoribbons, chiral nanoassemblies, nanosprings and nanocoils, in an accurate, efficient and systematic manner. In particular, chiral 1D 
nanomaterials (such as nanotubes or nanoribbons with intrinsic or applied twist) can be automatically handled by the package. 

The code has been developed under the auspices of a U.S. Department of Energy funded project (DOE Grant #DE-SC0023432 -- "Prediction and Tuning of 
Spin Selectivity Properties of Chiral Nanomaterials via an Integrated Machine Learning First Principles Approach"). The code has been primarily
developed by Amartya S. Banerjee (Assistant Professor, UCLA) and Shivang Agarwal (former graduate student at UCLA).

The package includes a number of input files with comments that explain the meaning of the input parameters. If you use HelicES, please cite the
